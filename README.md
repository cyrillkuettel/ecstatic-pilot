-	 Yolov4: Applied general object detection in constrained system. https://github.com/theAIGuysCode/tensorflow-yolov4-tflite
-	This is a sample ncnn android project: https://github.com/nihui/ncnn-android-nanodet/releases/download/v2/com.tencent.nanodetncnn-release.apk

### Qualcomm Neural Processing SDK
According to reasearch paper, Qualcomm SNPE provides a very low inference time. Performance exeeds all expectations. However, to integrate this forces a deeper understanding of the hardware.
