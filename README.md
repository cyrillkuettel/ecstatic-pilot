### Ideas
This is an interesting idea. Basically merge two images of two consecutive frames. 
"Because the camera is able to take more than 10 images / second and we need to analyze as many images as possible due to the high speed, the images are spilt in half and 2 consecutive frames are merged into one image. Like this the amount of images processed is almost doubled!"
And I will surely use concurrency where I can, probably in Java.
